              <p align="left">Titan Poker is the leading poker room in the expanding iPoker network, with lots of high value promotions for their players - monthly payouts have hit a massive $16 million guaranteed as of Sept. 2008. Games are loose, with lots of casino players, and the rake at Titan Poker is actually better than the online average with very player-friendly caps at lower stakes. Sign up through a PokerListings link and get a $600 sign-up bonus at 200% match plus $50 upfront on deposits over $100.</p>
          <p align="left">Titan Poker and iPoker have quickly built a strong network with strategic backing from the world's second largest casino-software provider, Playtech. The games at Titan Poker run smoothly, thanks to good software, although the game pace can be a little slow. Most of the traffic volume is still in the No-Limit Texas Hold'em games, where the viewed-flop percentage is normally in the 30s or 40s, making for profitable play for skilled players. Real-money player statistics as of November 2008 show 10,000 ring-game players and 55,000 tournament players at peak hours.</p>
