Our sponsers <a href=""http://www.toho9000.com"">TOHO9000 High Performance Car and Truck Engine Oil Treatment</a> have found a way to reduce your fuel consumption and increase engine power by 10%.</p><p>Regular engine oil is liquid, but as shown on the diagram, the gathering micro particles smaller than 1/100 micron are freely moving. As these microscopic particles mixed with the oxide, the carbon, or the sulfuric acid, they will grow into much bigger particles. As the particles become bigger, each particle increases in viscosity. Therefore, the particles can't go through the oil filter, causing the filter to lose its effect. Thus, the regular engine oil is not useful. Using <a href=""http://www.toho9000.com"">TOHO 9000</a>  in the regular engine oil controls the particles from growing, making it easier to go through the filter and maintaining its high performance.<br />   <br /> TOHO 900 oil particles are 3A and 5A, and that of regular engine oil 100A. The TOHO 9000 particles can penetrate deep into the internal metal parts of the engine, strongly performing its cleaning action, anti-rust protection and anticorrosion effect               </p><p align=""center""><img height=""234"" border=""0"" width=""350"" src=""http://toho9000.com/Pics/what2.jpg"" /> <img height=""227"" border=""0"" width=""250"" src=""http://toho9000.com/Pics/what3.jpg"" /></p>               <p align=""left"">When TOHO 9000 is added to regular engine oil, ester micro particles can suppress the gathering of regular engine oil particles and the bigger particles are being surrounded by the polarity particles, stopping the bigger particles from growing. <br /></p>The dispersion/dissociation effect of TOHO 9000 will cause the oil particles diameter to be less than 1 micron. The oil filter will not be blocked even after a long usage (the size of the filter&rsquo;s pore is one micron). Since the oil particles do not stick to the filter, it can reduce oil consumption and keep the environment clean by huge reduction in waste oil disposal. If TOHO 9000 is added to regular engine oil, oil filter&rsquo;s life span can be extended 4 to 10 times longer. Even though the sludge carbon will float in the oil as micro particles, causing the colour of the oil to turn black, this does not mean that the oil has degraded. It still remains useful.               <ul><li>                   <div align=""left""><strong>Clean the internal parts of engine</strong><br />       Keeps lubricating the internal parts of engine.<br />       Reduces wear and tear of piston ring.<br />       Lowers sludge formation behind piston rings to reduce sticking.</div>                 </li><li>                   <div align=""left""><strong>Economical</strong><br /> TOHO 9000 will not be evaporated even in high temperature.
